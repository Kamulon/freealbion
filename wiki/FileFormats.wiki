#summary Overview of the Albion data file formats.

= Introduction =

Albion was developed back in 1995 when piracy of PC games was on a much smaller scale than it is today and a simple CD present check was sufficient to prevent piracy (nobody had a CD writer back then!)

These pages attempt to document some of the different file formats used by the game.

== XLD Archives ==

||*Offset*||*Length*||*Name*||*Description*||
||0||4||magic||Magic number. The file signature (XLD0).||
||5||1||unknown||||
||7||2||entries||The number of objects stored within the archive.||
||9||entries `*` 4||lengths||A list of long integers (4 bytes) which store the length of the stored object.|||


== ITEMNAMES ==

The ITEMNAMES file contains the names of all the items within the game. They are translated into English, German and French.

Each record is 60 bytes long and there are 463 records.

||*Offset*||*Length*||*Description*||
||0||20||German text||
||21||20||English text||
||41||20||French text||

== ITEMGFX ==

Each item has an icon associated with it. Each image is 32x32 pixels in size with one byte per pixel. The images are indexed against a 256 color palette.

As yet I have not determined which palette.


== PALETTE.000 ==

This file contains 64 colors with 1 byte per component (r, g, ) per color. 

||*Offset*||*Length*||*Description*||
||0||1||Red||
||1||||Green||
||2||1||Blue||

There is no alpha channel.
