#summary Overview of the Albion data file formats.

= Introduction =

Albion was developed back in 1995 when piracy of PC games was on a much smaller scale than it is today and a simple CD present check was sufficient to prevent piracy (nobody had a CD writer back then!).

Because of this, few (if any) of the data files are encrypted. This page documents some of the different file formats used by the game.

*NOTE* All values are decimal unless written in the hexadecimal format e.g. 0xFF

== XLD Archives ==

The XLD file format is an uncompressed container format for the game resources. 

|| *Offset* || *Length* || *Name* || *Description* ||
||0||4||magic||Magic number. The file signature (XLD0).||
||4||1||unknown||||
||6||2||entries||The number of objects stored within the archive.||
||9||entries `*` 4||lengths||A list of long integers (4 bytes) which contains the length of the stored object.|||
||10||*||DATA||Binary data for the stored files.||

The rest of the file contains the stored objects, one after another.


== ITEMNAME.DAT ==

This file contains the names of all the items within the game. They are translated into English, German and French.

Each record is 60 bytes long and there are 462 records.

|| *Offset* || *Length* || *Description* ||
||0||20||German text||
||20||20||English text||
||40||20||French text||

== ITEMLIST.DAT ==

There are 462 records this file and each record is 40 bytes long. It is believe that, in the absence of any unique identifier in the file, the item ID is determined from its position in the file.

== ITEMGFX ==

Each item has an icon associated with it. Each image is 32x32 pixels in size with one byte per pixel. The images are indexed against a 256 color palette.

As yet I have not determined which palette.


== PALETTE.000 ==

This file contains 64 colors with 1 byte per component (r, g, b) per color. 

|| *Offset* || *Length* || *Description* ||
||0||1||Red||
||1||1||Green||
||2||1||Blue||

There is no alpha channel.

It is worth noting that each of the entries in PALETTE0.XLD is the same format as this, except that they contain 192 colours. They are merged with this palette to form a 256 colour palette.

== SPELLDAT.DAT ==

Unknown format. This file is 1050 bytes long and there are 53 spells in the game.

== SLAB ==

This is a 300x200 indexed image. I believe it is used as the background of the main menu. The palette is unknown.

== Intro Video ==

The introduction video is encoded as a [http://www.radgametools.com/ Rad Game Tools] Smacker video. The playback software for this is commercially licensed however there is an open source implementation in the [http://www.scummvm.org/ ScummVM] project.

== Cutscenes ==

Appear to be encoded as FLI files, a detailled description of which can be found [http://www.compuphase.com/flic.htm here].

== Sounds / Audio Samples ==

Appear to be raw PCM audio. Not certain about the format of the PCM though (bit rate, channels, etc).
