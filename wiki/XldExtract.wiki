#summary Documentation for the XldExtract utility

= XldExtract =

This is a utility for extracting the data from XLD archives to allow it to be analysed further and the test application for the XLD extraction code that's shared between other tools.

== Usage ==

Presently the only argument is the path to the XLD archive that you wish to have extracted.

== Current Limitations ==

The code needs a little work, which I am going to do very soon but because of this there are some caveats you should be aware of.

  # You must create a directory named 'out' in your working directory. The utility outputs all it's extracted content there at the moment.

  # All extracted content be named testN.mid where N is the position of the file in the archive.
